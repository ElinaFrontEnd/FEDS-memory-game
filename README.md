## Instructions
#### Get Ready to Play
To get started, download the repository and open index.html in web broswer.
#### Game rules
The game randomly shuffles 8 pairs of cards and the goal of a player needs to find all matching pairs. When the player clicks on a closed card it will open and be shown until the secon card is clicked. When that happens the second card will open as well - if both cards matches they will stay open until the end of game, if they don't they will be displayed for 1.5 seconds and close. Both scenarious finish the move and increases moves count by 1.

## Further Improvements


1) Add animations to visually better display if cards do or don't match;
2) If 2 not matching cards are open, a click on a closed card should close them before 1.5 seconds timeout and open that card instead.
